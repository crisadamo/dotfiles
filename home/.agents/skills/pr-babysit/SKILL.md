# PR Babysitter

You are a PR babysitter agent. Your job is to monitor GitHub pull requests, detect issues (CI failures, review comments, merge conflicts), and fix them autonomously. Fixes and commits happen **only** inside subagents (spawned via `spawn_subagent`) with worktree isolation — never as direct orchestrator edits on the main workspace. You support three PR topologies:

1. **Independent PRs** — standalone PRs targeting the default branch.
2. **Graphite stacks** — stacked PRs managed by the Graphite CLI (`gt`). Detected via `gt` metadata or API-based chain walking.
3. **GitHub stacked PRs** — stacked PRs managed by the `gh stack` CLI extension. Detected via `gh stack checkout` or API-based chain walking.

Designed for use with `/loop`: `/loop 5m /pr-babysit check`.

## Todo Scaffold

For each PR being babysat, create three todos:
- `pr-<n>:ci-green` — all CI checks passing
- `pr-<n>:comments-addressed` — all open review comments either replied to or fixed
- `pr-<n>:merge-ready` — labels applied, base up to date, ready to merge

Terminal state: all `pr-<n>:merge-ready` complete. Persist polling between turns via background subagents or scheduler tasks. **Note on backing:** the gate's heuristic requires `|in_progress_todos| ≤ count(live backing tasks)` for backing to apply (see `<task_completion_discipline>` Rule 4 for the full backing-detection rules). For `/pr-babysit` this means one polling subagent per PR you're babysitting, not one shared poller for all of them — otherwise the gate correctly classifies the excess in_progress todos as unbacked and will nudge.

**Reseed after compaction** — the harness no longer emits a pre-compaction todo snapshot, so if a compaction lands mid-cycle the orchestrator must rebuild its todo scaffold from the persisted PR list (see §State File of this skill). Reseed before doing anything else: read the state file, regenerate the per-PR `pr-<n>:ci-green` / `pr-<n>:comments-addressed` / `pr-<n>:merge-ready` triples for every watched PR.

## Commands

Dispatch based on the first argument. If no arguments are provided, show usage help.

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `add <number> [<number>...]` | Add PR(s) to the watchlist. Auto-detect stack membership (Graphite or GitHub stacked PRs) and register the entire stack. |
| `remove <number>` | Remove the specified PR from the watchlist. Only removes that single PR, even if it belongs to a stack. |
| `list` | Show all watched PRs grouped by stack, with status, last checked time, and fix count. |
| `check` | Run one check cycle — query each PR, detect issues, fix them. |

## State File

The state file is **per-session** so that concurrent Grok sessions do not interfere with each other. Subagent IDs and worktree paths are session-scoped and cannot be shared across sessions.

Path: `~/.grok/plugin-data/pr-babysit/watched-prs-<INSTANCE_ID>.json`

The `<INSTANCE_ID>` is a UUID generated once per session on the first `add` command and stored inside the state file. This avoids relying on any external session ID (which is not exposed to the model).

### State file lifecycle

1. **First `add` in a session**: Generate a UUID via `python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`, create the state file with that UUID embedded, and persist the filename. Hold the `INSTANCE_ID` in memory for the rest of the session.
2. **Subsequent `add` / `remove` / `list` / `check` calls in the same session**: The agent already knows the `INSTANCE_ID` from the first `add` call (it is in the conversation context). Use the same filename.
3. **`/loop` scheduled calls**: The `/loop` scheduler fires within the same session, so the agent's conversation context retains the `INSTANCE_ID`. If for any reason the `INSTANCE_ID` is not in context (e.g., after context compaction), scan `~/.grok/plugin-data/pr-babysit/` for `watched-prs-*.json` files and select the one whose `instance_id` field matches a file modified recently, or whose PRs match the current repo. If exactly one file matches the current repo, use it.

Create the directory and file if they do not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.grok/plugin-data/pr-babysit
INSTANCE_ID=$(python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())")
```

Initialize with:

```json
{
  "instance_id": "<INSTANCE_ID>",
  "prs": [],
  "groups": {}
}
```

Full schema for a watched PR entry:

```json
{
  "number": 170734,
  "repo": "xai-org/xai",
  "branch": "skory/feature-part-1",
  "stack_id": "abc123",
  "stack_type": "graphite",
  "stack_position": 0,
  "added_at": "2026-04-13T12:00:00Z",
  "last_checked": "2026-04-13T12:05:00Z",
  "last_status": "healthy",
  "check_count": 12,
  "fix_count": 2
}
```

Fields:
- `number` — GitHub PR number.
- `repo` — Repository in `owner/name` format.
- `branch` — Head branch name.
- `stack_id` — Shared identifier for PRs in the same stack (`null` if standalone). For Graphite stacks, this is the bottom branch name. For GitHub stacked PRs, this is `"gh-stack-<bottom_pr_number>"`.
- `stack_type` — One of: `"graphite"`, `"github"` (GitHub stacked PRs via `gh stack`), or `null` (standalone/plain git). Determines which CLI tool is used for restack/push operations.
- `stack_position` — Distance from trunk (0 = closest to trunk, i.e. bottom of stack).
- `added_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp when the PR was added.
- `last_checked` — ISO 8601 timestamp of last check cycle.
- `last_status` — One of: `"healthy"`, `"ci_failed"`, `"ci_needs_attention"`, `"changes_requested"`, `"review_comments"`, `"conflicts"`, `"pending"`, `"mergeable_unknown"`, `"error"`.
- `check_count` — Total number of check cycles run against this PR.
- `fix_count` — Total number of automated fixes applied.

Full schema for the `groups` map (tracks subagents and worktrees per non-overlapping group):

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "<group_key>": {
      "subagent_id": "019d91b8-21e0-7c41-91a0-2b163d2c5481",
      "worktree_path": "/path/to/worktree"
    }
  }
}
```

- `<group_key>` — the `stack_id` for stacks or `"pr-<number>"` for standalone PRs.
- `subagent_id` — ID of the last subagent that processed this group. Used with `resume_from` to continue the subagent's conversation across check cycles.
- `worktree_path` — absolute path to the worktree created by `spawn_subagent`. Referenced for cleanup when all PRs in the group are removed.

When a group is cleaned up (all PRs removed), delete its `groups[group_key]` entry.

**Multi-repo safety**: The check cycle determines the current repo via:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
```

Only process PRs whose `repo` field matches this value. Split `nameWithOwner` into `OWNER` and `REPO` for API calls.

## Adding PRs

When the user runs `/pr-babysit add <number> [<number>...]`:

### Step 1: Verify authentication

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated, report the error and stop.

### Step 2: Fetch PR details

For each PR number:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json headRefName,baseRefName,url,title,state,number
```

Verify the PR exists and is open. If MERGED or CLOSED, inform the user and skip.

Determine the current repository:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
```

Store this value as the `repo` field for all PR entries created in this invocation.

### Step 3: Detect stack membership

Stack detection determines whether the PR is standalone or part of a stack (Graphite or GitHub stacked PRs). Three methods are tried in order; the first one that finds a multi-branch stack wins.

#### Method A: API-based chain detection (universal, always runs first)

This method works regardless of which tool created the stack. It detects any chain of PRs where each PR's base branch is another PR's head branch.

```bash
# Get the default branch for the repo
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')

# Get the base branch of the added PR
BASE=$(gh pr view <number> --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName')
HEAD=$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
```

If `BASE == DEFAULT_BRANCH`, the PR might still be mid-stack (other PRs could target its head branch). Check both directions:

Fetch all open PRs in the repo once and reuse for both directions:

```bash
# Fetch all open PRs in the repo (used for both downstack and upstack walks)
ALL_PRS=$(gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,baseRefName --limit 200)
```

**Walk downstack** (toward trunk): Starting from the added PR, follow `baseRefName` by looking up which open PR’s `headRefName` matches the current PR’s `baseRefName`. Repeat until `baseRefName == DEFAULT_BRANCH`.

**Walk upstack** (away from trunk): Find open PRs whose `baseRefName` matches the current PR’s `headRefName`, and continue upward. Repeat until no more PRs are found.
The result is an ordered list of `(number, headRefName, baseRefName)` tuples, sorted bottom-up (closest to trunk first).

If only one PR was found (no chain), this PR is standalone. Proceed to Step 4.

If multiple PRs were found, this is a stack. Continue to Method B/C to determine the stack type and tool.

#### Method B: Graphite CLI detection

Run only if the API chain detected multiple PRs.

```bash
# Check if graphite CLI is available
gt --help 2>/dev/null | grep -qi graphite
```

If graphite is available:

```bash
git fetch origin <headRefName>
gt checkout <headRefName> 2>/dev/null
```

If `gt checkout` succeeds (the branch is tracked by graphite locally), verify the stack by walking:

```bash
# Go to the bottom of the stack
gt bottom 2>/dev/null

# Collect branches bottom-up
STACK_BRANCHES=()
while true; do
  BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
  STACK_BRANCHES+=("$BRANCH")
  # Try to move up; if gt up fails, we're at the top
  gt up 2>/dev/null || break
done
```

If `gt checkout` fails (branch not tracked — **common when the PR was created on a different machine**), import the stack into graphite using the API-detected chain:

```bash
# Sync graphite metadata from remote.
# Warning: --force overwrites all local Graphite metadata. This is safe in the
# cross-machine scenario but could disrupt other locally-tracked Graphite stacks.
# Log whether this succeeds or fails for debugging.
gt sync --force --no-interactive 2>/dev/null || true

# Try checkout again after sync
gt checkout <headRefName> 2>/dev/null
```

If checkout still fails, manually track each branch in the chain using the API-detected topology:

```bash
# Save current branch to restore after tracking
ORIG_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current || echo "main")

# For each branch in the API-detected chain (bottom-up order):
# First branch's parent is the default branch
git fetch origin
for i in "${!CHAIN_BRANCHES[@]}"; do
  BRANCH="${CHAIN_BRANCHES[$i]}"
  if [ $i -eq 0 ]; then
    PARENT="$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
  else
    PARENT="${CHAIN_BRANCHES[$((i-1))]}"
  fi
  git checkout -B "$BRANCH" "origin/$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
  gt track --parent "$PARENT" --no-interactive 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Restore original branch to avoid polluting the main workspace
git checkout "$ORIG_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
```

After tracking, verify with `gt bottom` / `gt up` as above. If the walk succeeds and matches the API-detected chain, set `stack_type: "graphite"`.

If graphite tracking still fails (e.g., `gt track` rejects the branch, repo not initialized), fall through to Method C.

#### Method C: GitHub Stacked PRs detection

Run only if Method B did not claim the stack (graphite not available or tracking failed).

**Note**: GitHub Stacked PRs (`gh stack`) is currently in private preview. If the repository does not have the feature enabled, `gh stack` commands will fail even if the extension is installed. In that case, Method C falls through and the stack is treated as a plain git chain.

```bash
# Check if gh-stack extension is installed (don't use `gh stack view` — it exits
# non-zero (code 2) when the current branch isn't in a tracked stack, giving
# false negatives even when the extension is installed)
gh extension list 2>/dev/null | grep -q gh-stack
```

If `gh stack` is installed:

```bash
# Try to check out the stack from the PR number
# Exit code 2 = not a GitHub stack (fall through)
# Exit code 4 = API failure (log error, fall through)
# Exit code 0 = success
gh stack checkout <number> 2>/dev/null
```

If `gh stack checkout` succeeds (exit code 0):

```bash
# Get the stack structure
STACK_JSON=$(gh stack view --json 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse `STACK_JSON` to extract the ordered list of branches and their PR numbers. Set `stack_type: "github"`.

If `gh stack checkout` exits with code 2 (not a GitHub stack), fall through silently. If it exits with code 4 (API failure), log a warning and fall through. For any other non-zero exit code, log and fall through.

If `gh stack` is not installed, fall through.

#### Final classification

| Condition | `stack_type` | `stack_id` |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Method B succeeded (graphite tracks the stack) | `"graphite"` | Bottom branch name |
| Method C succeeded (GitHub stacked PR) | `"github"` | `"gh-stack-<bottom_pr_number>"` |
| API chain found multiple PRs but neither tool claims them | `null` | `"chain-<bottom_pr_number>"` |
| Only one PR found (no chain) | `null` | `null` |

For all stack types, assign `stack_position` by index: 0 = bottom (closest to trunk), incrementing upward.

For each branch in the stack, resolve its PR number:

```bash
gh pr view <branch> --json number --jq '.number'
```

If `gh pr view <branch>` fails for a branch (no associated PR, or PR is closed), skip that branch and warn the user.

### Step 4: Register PR(s)

Register the PR(s) determined by Step 3:
- **Stack detected**: Register **all** PRs in the stack with the appropriate `stack_id`, `stack_type`, and `stack_position`.
- **No stack detected**: Register the single PR with `stack_id: null`, `stack_type: null`, and `stack_position: 0`.

### Step 5: Write state and report

- Deduplicate: skip any PR number + repo combination already in the watchlist.
- Write the updated state file.
- Report what was added, including stack information if applicable.

For multiple PR numbers (`add 123 456 789`): process each number, dedup across all of them.

## Removing PRs

When the user runs `/pr-babysit remove <number>`:

1. Read the state file.
2. Determine the current repo.
3. Remove the PR entry matching both `number` and `repo`.
4. Write the updated state file.
5. Report confirmation, or "not found" if no match.

## Listing PRs

When the user runs `/pr-babysit list`:

1. Read the state file.
2. Determine the current repo. Filter to PRs matching the current repo.
3. Display a table: Number | Branch | Status | Last Checked | Fixes.
4. Group by `stack_id`. Show standalone PRs separately.

## Check Cycle

This is the core loop. It runs on manual `/pr-babysit check` and on scheduled triggers via `/loop`.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. Verify authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

2. Determine the current repo:
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
   ```
   Split into `OWNER` and `REPO` for API calls.

3. Fetch latest refs:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

### Step 2: Read state and validate

1. Read the state file. If it does not exist, create the default and exit.
   **State migration**: After reading, check each PR entry for missing fields added in later versions (`stack_id`, `stack_type`, `stack_position`). If any field is missing, backfill with defaults: `stack_id: null`, `stack_type: null`, `stack_position: 0`. Also ensure `groups` key exists (default `{}`). Re-persist the state file after migration. This ensures backward compatibility with legacy state files created before stack support was added.
2. Filter `prs` to only those matching the current repo.
3. If the filtered list is empty: clean up any stale `groups` entries (run Step 7 cleanup for all remaining groups that no longer have associated PRs, then clear the `groups` map and re-persist the state file). Then call `scheduler_list`. If any scheduled task's prompt contains `pr-babysit`, call `scheduler_delete` with that task's ID to self-terminate the loop. Report "No PRs in watchlist" and exit.

### Step 3: Group, order, and identify non-overlapping groups

Group PRs by `stack_id`. Process stacks **bottom-up** (ascending `stack_position`). Process standalone PRs (`stack_id: null`) in any order.

Identify **non-overlapping groups** for parallel processing:
- Each stack (set of PRs sharing the same `stack_id`, regardless of `stack_type`) is one group.
- Each standalone PR (`stack_id: null`) is its own group.
- These groups are independent and will be processed in parallel via separate worktrees and subagents.
- The `stack_type` field determines which CLI tool the subagent uses for restack/push operations within each group.

### Step 4: Parallel Processing with Worktrees

For each non-overlapping group identified in Step 3, launch a subagent to process it in parallel. `spawn_subagent`'s `isolation: "worktree"` parameter handles worktree creation automatically.

#### 4a. Subagent dispatch

Launch one subagent per non-overlapping group by calling `spawn_subagent`. Use a `group_key` to identify each group: the `stack_id` for stacks or `"pr-<number>"` for standalone PRs.

**Launch order**: Launch subagents one at a time (sequentially), but do NOT wait for any subagent's output before launching the next one. All subagents use `background: true`, so each launch returns immediately with a `task_id`. Collect all `task_id`s first, then move to Step 4b to wait for results. This ensures all groups run concurrently.

**Max concurrency**: Launch at most **8** subagents concurrently. If there are more than 8 non-overlapping groups, process them in batches: launch the first 8 groups, wait for all to complete (Step 4b), then launch the next batch. This prevents resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk from worktrees, GitHub API rate limits) at scale.

**Resumption logic**: Before launching, check if `groups[group_key]` exists in the state file (see State File section for schema).

- **If `groups[group_key].subagent_id` exists**: Resume the previous subagent using `resume_from: <stored_subagent_id>`. The resumed subagent is expected to inherit its previous worktree and full conversation context (verify this behavior on first use). Pass the new cycle's PR list and instructions as the prompt. **Fallback**: If resumption fails (subagent not found, session expired, tool rejects the ID), log a warning, discard the stale `subagent_id` from `groups[group_key]`, and launch a fresh subagent instead. Update `groups[group_key]` with the new `subagent_id` and `worktree_path`.
- **If no prior subagent exists**: Launch a fresh subagent.

In both cases, use these `spawn_subagent` parameters:

- `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
- `isolation: "worktree"` (`spawn_subagent` creates and manages the worktree automatically)
- `background: true` (to process groups in parallel)
- `description: "[pr-babysit] <group_key>"` (e.g., `"[pr-babysit] pr-12345"` or `"[pr-babysit] stack-abc123"`). The `[pr-babysit]` prefix is parsed by the pager's subagent label renderer (see `format_subagent_label` in `xai-grok-pager`) so the subagent row shows "Pr-babysit" at the top instead of the generic "General" fallback. Keep the same description on `resume_from` follow-ups so the label stays stable across cycles.

The subagent prompt must include:
- The list of PRs in this group (with stack ordering if applicable)
- The `stack_type` for this group (`"graphite"`, `"github"`, or `null`) so the subagent knows which CLI tool to use for restack/push
- The repo `OWNER` and `REPO` values
- The full subagent logic from Step 5 below (Query + Decision Tree)
- The required JSON output format from Step 4b (the `pr_results` summary block that the subagent must emit at the end of its output)

Each subagent handles its group's PRs end-to-end: query, diagnose, fix, commit, push.

**Launch failure handling**: If the `spawn_subagent` call itself fails for a group (e.g., quota exceeded, invalid `resume_from` ID, network error), do NOT abort the entire cycle. Instead: log the error, set `last_status` to `"error"` for all PRs in that group, clear `groups[group_key].subagent_id` (so the next cycle retries with a fresh subagent), and continue launching subagents for the remaining groups. Only successfully launched subagents (those with valid `task_id`s) are added to the `task_id`/`group_key` mapping for Step 4b collection.

#### 4b. Wait and collect results

**Only begin this step after ALL subagents from Step 4a have been launched.** Do not call `get_command_or_subagent_output` for any subagent until every group's subagent has been started and you have all `task_id`s in hand.

**Maintain a `task_id` to `group_key` mapping**: As you launch each subagent in Step 4a, record the returned `task_id` alongside its `group_key` (e.g., in a list of `{task_id, group_key}` pairs). When collecting results below, use this mapping to associate each `get_command_or_subagent_output` result with the correct group for state updates.

Then, for each subagent (iterating over the `task_id`/`group_key` pairs), use `get_command_or_subagent_output` with `block: true` and `timeout_ms: 1800000` (30 minutes) to collect results.

**If a subagent fails**: log the error, set `last_status` to `"error"` for all PRs in that group, and continue collecting results from other groups. A single failed subagent must not block the entire check cycle.

**If `get_command_or_subagent_output` times out**: the subagent may still be running in the background. Kill it with `kill_command_or_subagent(<task_id>)`, clear `groups[group_key].subagent_id` (so the next cycle launches a fresh subagent rather than trying to resume a killed one), and set `last_status` to `"error"` for all PRs in that group.

Each subagent must conclude its output with a structured JSON summary block for reliable parsing:

```json
{"pr_results": [
  {"number": 123, "last_status": "healthy", "fix_count_delta": 1, "removed": false},
  {"number": 124, "last_status": "ci_failed", "fix_count_delta": 2, "removed": false}
]}
```

Fields per PR:
- `last_status` — the status after processing
- `fix_count_delta` — number of fixes applied this cycle
- `removed` — `true` if the PR was merged/closed and removed from the watchlist

Merge the results from all subagents into the main state.

**After collecting each subagent's result**, update `groups[group_key]` in the state. Both values come from `spawn_subagent`'s return value (not from the subagent's JSON output):
- `subagent_id`: The `task_id` returned by the `spawn_subagent` call. Store this for use with `resume_from` on the next cycle.
- `worktree_path`: When `isolation: "worktree"` is used, `spawn_subagent`'s result includes a `worktree_path` field with the absolute path to the created worktree. Store this for use in Step 7 cleanup.

### Step 5: Subagent Logic — Query and Decision Tree

This section defines the logic each subagent executes for its assigned group of PRs.

#### Worktree initialization

`spawn_subagent`'s `isolation: "worktree"` parameter provides a clean worktree automatically. The subagent is already running inside the worktree; no `cd` or manual setup is needed.

**Warning**: `git checkout <branch>` will fail if that branch is already checked out in the main workspace or another worktree (git prohibits the same branch ref in multiple worktrees). To avoid this, use `git checkout -B <branch> origin/<branch>` which force-creates the local branch at the remote tracking ref, or use detached HEAD via `git checkout --detach origin/<branch>`. This is uncommon in normal usage since the main workspace is typically on `main`, but if it occurs, log a specific warning identifying the branch conflict and advise the user to switch branches in the main workspace.

**Fetch remote refs before any fix action, not unconditionally at startup.** If the PR is healthy, pending, merged, or in an unknown mergeable state, no git operations are needed and fetching wastes time and creates lock contention. Instead, track a boolean `has_fetched` flag (initially false) per subagent. Before the first operation that requires up-to-date refs (any `git checkout`, `git rebase`, or `gt restack`), check `has_fetched` -- if false, run the fetch and set it to true. Note: `gh stack rebase` handles its own fetch internally, so the `has_fetched` guard is not needed before it.

```bash
git fetch origin || (sleep 2 && git fetch origin) || FETCH_FAILED=true
```

If `FETCH_FAILED` is set, the subagent must set `last_status` to `"error"` for the current PR, log that both fetch attempts failed, and skip all git operations for this PR. Do not attempt checkout, rebase, or restack with stale refs.

The retry handles transient lock contention when multiple subagents fetch in parallel. This fetch is critical -- without fresh refs, `git rebase origin/<baseRefName>` or `gt restack` will rebase onto stale history and either fail or produce incorrect results. (`gh stack rebase` fetches internally and does not require this pre-fetch.)

Initialize a per-cycle fix counter for each PR assigned to this subagent (in memory, not persisted). Set each to 0.

#### Query each PR

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,headRefName,baseRefName
```

If `gh pr view` fails (network error, rate limit, auth expired), log the error, set `last_status` to `"error"`, and continue to the next PR.

#### Decision tree

Evaluate the PR state in this order:

1. Handle critical actions in order: MERGED/CLOSED, CONFLICTS, CI FAILED. If MERGED/CLOSED matched, skip all remaining steps for this PR. CONFLICTS and CI FAILED are **not** exclusive — after resolving conflicts, continue to CI failures in the same cycle. `mergeable` being `"UNKNOWN"` does **not** block processing; proceed with all other checks normally.
2. Then, **always** check for changes-requested review feedback (review-level body) and unresolved inline review threads, regardless of whether a critical action was handled above. A PR can have CI failures AND review comments simultaneously.
3. Finally, determine the terminal status: if CI checks are cancelled/timed-out (with no failures), set `"ci_needs_attention"`. If checks are still pending (no failures or cancellations), set `"pending"`. If everything is green (mergeable, no failed/cancelled checks, no changes requested, no unresolved threads), set `"healthy"`. If no branch matched at all, set `"error"`.
4. Before each individual fix action (resolving conflicts, fixing a CI check, addressing a review comment), check the per-cycle fix counter for this PR. If it has reached 3, skip the **code change** but do **not** abandon the PR or skip remaining threads. All remaining review threads must still be evaluated. For threads that need a code change but the cap prevents it, reply with a substantive technical description of what change is needed and note it will be addressed in the next cycle. Increment the counter after each successful fix action.
5. Replying to comment threads (questions/clarifications or cap-deferred explanations) does not count toward the fix cap.

**`last_status` precedence**: When multiple sections match for the same PR (e.g., conflicts resolved, then review comments processed), each section may set `last_status`. The last section to execute wins. The evaluation order defined above determines precedence — review-related statuses take priority over CI/conflict statuses because they run later.

#### MERGED or CLOSED

`state` is `"MERGED"` or `"CLOSED"`.

Report this PR as removed by setting `removed: true` in the JSON output. The parent agent handles the actual state file update. Log that it was removed and why.

#### Mergeable Unknown

`mergeable` is `"UNKNOWN"`. GitHub has not yet computed mergeability.

Note this state but **do not block**. Continue processing the PR normally — check for CI failures, review comments, and other actionable items. Mergeability often resolves itself after a push or a short delay. Only set `last_status` to `"mergeable_unknown"` as a fallback if no other status was assigned during processing (no CI failures, no review comments, no conflicts).

#### Merge Conflicts

`mergeable` is `"CONFLICTING"` or `mergeStateStatus` is `"DIRTY"`.

Resolve conflicts first before attempting any other fixes, since conflicts are often the root cause of CI failures. Each conflict resolution counts as one fix action — check the per-cycle counter before attempting.

**Graphite-managed branches** (`stack_type` is `"graphite"`):

```bash
gt checkout <branch>
gt restack --no-interactive
```

If `gt restack` encounters conflicts:
1. Identify the conflicting files from the restack output.
2. Read each conflicting file **in full** (not just the conflict region). Conflict markers look like:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (parent branch version -- the branch being restacked onto)
   =======
   (current branch version -- the commit being replayed)
   >>>>>>> <commit-hash>
   ```
   `gt restack` performs a rebase internally, so `HEAD` (top section) is the **parent** branch and the bottom section is the **current** branch's changes.

   Resolution strategy:
   - Read surrounding context beyond the markers to understand each side's intent.
   - If both sides added non-overlapping code (e.g., different functions, different imports), keep both additions in logical order.
   - If both sides modified the same lines, combine the changes or prefer the current branch's version when it represents the intended new behavior.
   - Remove **all** conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) -- leftover markers will break compilation.
   - After resolving each file, re-read it to verify it is syntactically valid and logically consistent with the rest of the codebase.
3. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved_files>
   ```
4. Continue the restack:
   ```bash
   gt continue
   ```
5. After all conflicts are resolved and the restack completes, verify the result builds. Run the appropriate build/lint command for the affected files (e.g., `cargo check` for Rust, `python -m py_compile <file>` for Python, `npx tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript). If the build fails, fix the issue before submitting -- pushing broken code triggers CI failures that consume another fix cycle.

After restacking, submit the entire stack:

```bash
gt submit --stack --no-edit --no-interactive
```

**GitHub stacked PRs** (`stack_type` is `"github"`):

```bash
# Use the PR number (not branch name) to ensure the stack is locally tracked
# in this worktree context — branch-name checkout only resolves against
# locally tracked stacks, which may not exist if the add step ran in a
# different worktree.
# Retry on exit code 8 (stack locked by another process) per Safety Guardrails.
gh stack checkout <number> || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack checkout <number>; fi; }
gh stack rebase || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack rebase; fi; }
```

If `gh stack rebase` encounters conflicts:
1. The rebase pauses and prints the conflicted files with line numbers. Resolve them using the same strategy as Graphite conflicts above (read full file, understand both sides, combine changes, remove markers).
2. Stage resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved_files>
   ```
3. Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   gh stack rebase --continue
   ```
4. If the rebase cannot be resolved, abort and report:
   ```bash
   gh stack rebase --abort
   ```
5. After all conflicts are resolved, verify the result builds (same as Graphite section above).

After rebasing, push the entire stack:

```bash
gh stack push || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack push; fi; }
```

For stacks without conflicts, `gh stack sync` can replace the separate rebase + push steps as a single command (fetch + rebase + push + PR state sync). However, using separate commands gives more control for conflict handling, so prefer the explicit flow when conflicts are possible.

**Plain git branches** (`stack_type` is `null` or standalone PR):

```bash
git checkout <branch>
git rebase origin/<baseRefName>
```

If the rebase encounters conflicts:
1. Identify the conflicting files from the rebase output.
2. Read each conflicting file **in full** (not just the conflict region). Conflict markers look like:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (base branch version -- during rebase, HEAD is the branch being rebased onto)
   =======
   (PR branch version -- the commit being replayed)
   >>>>>>> <commit-hash>
   ```
   **Important**: During `git rebase`, the sides are swapped compared to `git merge`. `HEAD` (above `=======`) is the *base* branch's code (e.g., `origin/main`), and the bottom section is the PR's incoming changes being replayed on top.

   Resolution strategy:
   - Read surrounding context beyond the markers to understand each side's intent.
   - If both sides added non-overlapping code (e.g., different functions, different imports), keep both additions in logical order.
   - If both sides modified the same lines, combine the changes or prefer the PR's version when it represents the intended new behavior.
   - Remove **all** conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) -- leftover markers will break compilation.
   - After resolving each file, re-read it to verify it is syntactically valid and logically consistent with the rest of the codebase.
3. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved_files>
   ```
4. Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
5. After all conflicts are resolved and the rebase completes, verify the result builds. Run the appropriate build/lint command for the affected files (e.g., `cargo check` for Rust, `python -m py_compile <file>` for Python, `npx tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript). If the build fails, fix the issue before pushing -- pushing broken code triggers CI failures that consume another fix cycle.

After resolving, push:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

Post a summary comment:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "Automated fix: resolved merge conflicts and rebased."
```

Set `last_status` to `"conflicts"`. Increment the per-cycle fix counter for this PR.

#### CI Failed

`statusCheckRollup` contains one or more checks with `conclusion` of `"FAILURE"` or `"ERROR"`.

For each failed check, the fix counts as one fix action — check the per-cycle counter before attempting each one.

1. List failed checks with their run IDs:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <number> --json name,state,link
   ```
   Extract the run ID from the `link` field URL. The URL format is `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run_id>/...` — parse `<run_id>` from it. Alternatively:
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch <headRefName> --json databaseId,name,conclusion \
     --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure")'
   ```

2. For each failed check, read logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run_id> --log-failed 2>/dev/null | tail -100
   ```

3. Checkout the branch (the worktree initialization fetch ensures refs are current):
   ```bash
   git checkout <headRefName>
   git rebase origin/<headRefName>
   ```

4. Diagnose the failure from the logs. Read relevant source files.

5. Fix the code.

6. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "fix: address CI failure in <check_name>"
   ```
   If graphite-managed (`stack_type: "graphite"`):
   ```bash
   gt submit --stack --no-edit --no-interactive
   ```
   If GitHub stacked PR (`stack_type: "github"`):
   ```bash
   gh stack push || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack push; fi; }
   ```
   If plain git (`stack_type: null`):
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

Post a summary comment:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "Automated fix: addressed CI failure in <check_name>."
```

Set `last_status` to `"ci_failed"`. Increment the per-cycle fix counter for this PR after each individual check fix.

#### Changes Requested

`reviewDecision` is `"CHANGES_REQUESTED"`.

This section handles the **review-level body** only (the top-level summary the reviewer wrote when requesting changes). Individual inline comment threads are handled separately in "Unresolved Review Comments" below to avoid double-processing.

Check the per-cycle fix counter before proceeding. If it has reached 3, do **not** silently skip. Post a general PR comment explaining that the review-level feedback was evaluated but the fix cap for this cycle has been reached, include a substantive technical summary of what needs to change, and note it will be addressed in the next cycle:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "Fix cap reached for this cycle. Review-level feedback evaluated but not yet addressed: <detailed technical summary of the needed changes>. This will be addressed in the next check cycle."
```

This comment does not count toward the fix cap. Then move on to the next section.

1. Fetch reviews:
   ```bash
   NO_COLOR=1 gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
     --jq '.[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED")'
   ```

2. Read the review body text (not individual inline comments — those are handled by the "Unresolved Review Comments" section). If the review body contains actionable high-level feedback that is not already covered by inline threads, address it.

3. Checkout the branch, address the review-body feedback in code.

4. Commit with a descriptive message and push:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
   ```
   If graphite-managed (`stack_type: "graphite"`):
   ```bash
   gt submit --stack --no-edit --no-interactive
   ```
   If GitHub stacked PR (`stack_type: "github"`):
   ```bash
   gh stack push || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack push; fi; }
   ```
   If plain git (`stack_type: null`):
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

Post a summary comment:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "Automated fix: addressed review feedback."
```

If the review body contained actionable feedback that was addressed, set `last_status` to `"changes_requested"` and increment the per-cycle fix counter. If the review body was empty or contained no actionable feedback beyond what inline threads cover, leave `last_status` unchanged.

#### Unresolved Review Comments (ALWAYS check)

**Always run this check**, even if a previous branch (CI, conflicts, changes requested) already matched. A PR can have both CI failures AND unresolved review threads. Skip this only if the PR was MERGED/CLOSED (removed). **Every single unresolved thread must be evaluated and acted upon. Do not silently skip any thread for any reason.**

1. Fetch review threads. **Important**: `gh api graphql` injects ANSI escape codes into its output even when piped. Set `NO_COLOR=1` and strip remaining escapes with `sed` before parsing JSON. Use `mktemp` for the output file to avoid races between concurrent invocations.
   ```bash
   THREADS_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pr_review_threads.XXXXXX.json")
   CURSOR=""
   ALL_THREADS="[]"
   while true; do
     AFTER_ARG=""
     if [ -n "$CURSOR" ]; then
       AFTER_ARG="-f cursor=$CURSOR"
     fi
     PAGE=$(NO_COLOR=1 gh api graphql -f owner="<OWNER>" -f name="<REPO>" -F number=<number> $AFTER_ARG -f query='
     query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $number: Int!, $cursor: String) {
       repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
         pullRequest(number: $number) {
           reviewThreads(first: 50, after: $cursor) {
             pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
             nodes {
               isResolved
               comments(first: 10) {
                 nodes {
                   author { login }
                   path
                   line
                   body
                   databaseId
                   url
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }' | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g')
     PAGE_NODES=$(echo "$PAGE" | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes')
     ALL_THREADS=$(echo "$ALL_THREADS" "$PAGE_NODES" | jq -s '.[0] + .[1]')
     HAS_NEXT=$(echo "$PAGE" | jq -r '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.pageInfo.hasNextPage')
     if [ "$HAS_NEXT" != "true" ]; then
       break
     fi
     CURSOR=$(echo "$PAGE" | jq -r '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.pageInfo.endCursor')
   done
   echo "$ALL_THREADS" > "$THREADS_FILE"
   ```

   The pagination loop fetches all review threads, not just the first 50. This is required to satisfy the mandate that every thread must be processed.

2. Filter to unresolved threads (`isResolved == false`).

3. Process **every** unresolved thread. No thread may be skipped, even if the fix cap has been reached. Each thread that requires a code change counts as one fix action — check the per-cycle counter before each. For each thread:

   **If a code change is reasonable AND the fix cap has NOT been reached** (the comment points out a bug, requests a refactor, suggests an improvement, or is otherwise actionable):
   - Checkout the branch, make the code change, then commit and push:
     ```bash
     git add -A && git commit -m "fix: address review comment on <path>"
     ```
     If graphite-managed (`stack_type: "graphite"`):
     ```bash
     gt submit --stack --no-edit --no-interactive
     ```
     If GitHub stacked PR (`stack_type: "github"`):
     ```bash
     gh stack push || { EXIT=$?; if [ $EXIT -eq 8 ]; then sleep 2 && gh stack push; fi; }
     ```
     If plain git (`stack_type: null`):
     ```bash
     git push
     ```
   - **After** the fix is pushed, reply to the thread referencing the commit SHA:
     ```bash
     COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
     NO_COLOR=1 gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{number}/comments/{databaseId}/replies \
       -X POST -f body="Addressed in ${COMMIT_SHA}: <brief description of what was changed>"
     ```
   - **Never** reply before the fix is pushed. The reply must reference a commit that already contains the fix.
   - Increment the per-cycle fix counter for this PR.

   **If a code change is reasonable BUT the fix cap has been reached** (counter is at 3):
   - Do **not** make the code change. Do **not** skip the thread.
   - Reply with a **substantive technical description** of what change is needed, which file(s) and line(s) are affected, and why the change is necessary. Note that the fix cap for this cycle has been reached and the change will be applied in the next cycle.
     ```bash
     NO_COLOR=1 gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{number}/comments/{databaseId}/replies \
       -X POST -f body="Fix cap reached for this cycle. The needed change: <detailed technical description of what to change and why>. This will be addressed in the next check cycle."
     ```
   - This reply is a substantive technical explanation (not a bare acknowledgment) and does not count toward the fix cap.

   **If the comment is a genuine question, discussion point, or out of scope** (the current code is correct, the suggestion is out of scope, or the comment asks for clarification):
   - Reply with a **substantive** explanation using the **numeric** `databaseId` from the GraphQL response (not the opaque node ID). Explain *why* the current code is correct, *why* the suggestion is out of scope, or provide the requested clarification with technical detail.
     ```bash
     NO_COLOR=1 gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{number}/comments/{databaseId}/replies \
       -X POST -f body="<substantive explanation>"
     ```

   **Never** reply with phrases like "Will fix", "Acknowledged", "Acked", "Noted", "Good point", "Good follow-up", "Makes sense", "Thanks for the feedback", or any reply that merely acknowledges a comment or defers a fix to a follow-up PR. If a comment points out a reasonable issue, fix it **now** in this cycle — do not defer to a follow-up. Every reply must either reference a commit SHA where the fix was already made, or provide a detailed technical explanation of why no code change is needed.

   **Semgrep findings**: When dismissing a `semgrep-code-scan` finding that is a false positive or not actionable, reply with the appropriate command: `/fp <comment>` for false positive, `/ar <comment>` for acceptable risk, or `/other <comment>` for all other reasons.

4. After all threads are processed, clean up the temp file:
   ```bash
   rm -f "$THREADS_FILE"
   ```

If any unresolved threads were found and processed (code change or substantive reply), set `last_status` to `"review_comments"`. If the filter above found zero unresolved threads, leave `last_status` unchanged from any earlier section.

#### Cancelled / Timed-Out CI Checks

`statusCheckRollup` contains one or more checks with `conclusion` of `"CANCELLED"`, `"TIMED_OUT"`, `"STARTUP_FAILURE"`, or `"STALE"`, and no checks have `conclusion` of `"FAILURE"` or `"ERROR"`.

Set `last_status` to `"ci_needs_attention"` and skip. Do not attempt fixes — these checks need manual re-triggering or investigation.

#### Checks Pending

Any check in `statusCheckRollup` has `status` of `"IN_PROGRESS"` or `"QUEUED"`, and no checks have failed or been cancelled.

Set `last_status` to `"pending"`. Do **not** let pending CI block action on already-identified issues — review comments, known failures from previous runs, and other actionable items must still be addressed even while checks are in progress.

#### All Green

Verify all of the following are true:
- `mergeable` is `"MERGEABLE"` (not `"CONFLICTING"` or `"UNKNOWN"`)
- No checks have `conclusion` of `"FAILURE"`, `"ERROR"`, `"CANCELLED"`, `"TIMED_OUT"`, `"STARTUP_FAILURE"`, or `"STALE"`
- `reviewDecision` is not `"CHANGES_REQUESTED"`
- No unresolved review threads exist (confirmed by the review comments check above)

If all conditions are met, update `last_status` to `"healthy"`. No action needed.

If none of the above decision branches matched (unexpected API state), set `last_status` to `"error"` and log a warning with the raw PR state for debugging.

### Step 6: Update state file

Write the updated state file with new values for `last_checked`, `last_status`, `check_count`, and `fix_count` for each processed PR. Also persist the updated `groups` map with current `subagent_id` and `worktree_path` values for each group. Persist state before worktree cleanup so that a crash during cleanup does not lose cycle results or subagent tracking.

### Step 7: Worktree cleanup (conservative)

Worktrees persist across cycles for subagent resumption. Do **not** aggressively clean up worktrees between cycles.

Only clean up a worktree when **all PRs in the group have been removed** (merged, closed, or explicitly removed from the watchlist) or when the user explicitly requests cleanup. Use `grok worktree rm` (not `git worktree remove`):

```bash
grok worktree rm --force <worktree_path>
```

The `<worktree_path>` comes from `groups[group_key].worktree_path` in the state file. After removing the worktree, also delete the `groups[group_key]` entry from the state file and re-persist the state.

Note: `grok worktree rm` is the preferred cleanup command. If `spawn_subagent` gains its own worktree cleanup mechanism in the future, prefer that instead to avoid inconsistencies with the tool's internal tracking.

### Step 8: Self-terminate if empty

After state persistence and worktree cleanup are complete: if all PRs for this repo were removed (merged/closed) during this cycle, call `scheduler_list`. If any scheduled task's prompt contains `pr-babysit`, call `scheduler_delete` with that task's ID to self-terminate the loop. Report and exit.

## Safety Guardrails

Follow these rules strictly:

- **Never force-push without `--force-with-lease`**. Always use `git push --force-with-lease`, never `git push --force`. Note: `gh stack push` and `gt submit` handle `--force-with-lease` internally, so no extra flags are needed when using those commands.
- **Never modify files outside the PR's branch**. Always verify you are on the correct branch before making changes.
- **All fix work happens in worktrees, never in the main workspace.** The main workspace tree must not be modified during a check cycle. Each non-overlapping group gets its own worktree via `isolation: "worktree"` on `spawn_subagent`.
- **Worktrees persist across cycles for subagent resumption.** Do not clean up worktrees unless all PRs in the group are removed. Use `grok worktree rm --force <path>` for cleanup, not `git worktree remove`.
- **Cap fix attempts at 3 per PR per cycle**. Track a per-cycle counter in memory. Initialize to 0 for each PR at the start of the cycle. Increment after each individual fix action (each CI check fix, each conflict resolution, each review thread addressed). When it reaches 3, skip further **code changes** but continue evaluating remaining review threads. For cap-blocked threads, reply with a substantive technical description of the needed change and note it will be addressed next cycle.
- **Never skip or ignore review comments.** Every unresolved thread must be evaluated and either addressed with a code change or responded to with a substantive reply. Silently skipping a thread is never acceptable.
- **Never reply to review comments with "will fix", "acknowledged", "acked", "good follow-up", or similar platitudes.** If a comment requires a code change, make the change **now** — do not defer to a follow-up PR or a future cycle. Make the fix first, then reply referencing the commit. If the comment is a question, provide a substantive answer. Empty acknowledgments and deferred fixes are never acceptable.
- **If a fix attempt fails**, log the error and continue to the next PR. Do not retry within the same cycle.
- **Always use `git add -A`** before committing to ensure new files are included.
- **If the state file is corrupted or unreadable**, start fresh with `{"instance_id": "<INSTANCE_ID>", "prs": [], "groups": {}}`. Log that the state was reset.
- **Never merge a PR**. The babysitter fixes issues but does not merge. Merging is a human decision.
- **Graphite operations may race across parallel worktrees.** All worktrees share a single `.git` directory, and `gt` stores metadata in shared git refs/config. If multiple subagents run `gt restack` or `gt submit` concurrently on different stacks, they may corrupt graphite's internal state. Mitigation: if a `gt` command fails with an unexpected error, retry once after a 2-second pause. If graphite race issues are observed in practice, fall back to processing graphite stacks sequentially (only parallelize standalone PRs).
- **GitHub stacked PRs (`gh stack`) use explicit locking** (exit code 8: "Stack is locked by another process"). All worktrees share the same `.git` directory, and `gh stack` stores state in `.git/gh-stack`, so concurrent `gh stack` operations from different worktrees will hit lock contention — even when operating on different stacks. Mitigation: if a `gh stack` command fails with exit code 8 (locked), retry once after a 2-second pause. If lock contention is frequent, fall back to processing GitHub stacks sequentially (same guidance as Graphite above). If `gh stack` is not installed, fall back to plain git operations for GitHub-style stacked PRs.
- **Cross-machine stack detection**: When a PR was created with Graphite or `gh stack` on a different machine, local CLI metadata may not exist. The API-based chain detection (Method A in Step 3) is the primary detection mechanism and works regardless of local tool state. Tool-specific methods (B and C) are used to determine the correct CLI for operations, with fallback to plain git if neither tool is available.
- **GitHub Stacked PRs do not support cross-fork stacks.** All branches in a GitHub stack must be in the same repository. This is unlikely to be hit since the babysitter operates within a single repo, but be aware of this constraint during detection.
- **Set `NO_COLOR=1`** when using `gh api` to avoid ANSI escape codes in output.
